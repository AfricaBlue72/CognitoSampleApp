# Cognito Sample
This very simple program shows how you can login into a User Pool and access some resources in AWS.

You must yourself create an User in the User Pool and place this user into the correct User Group.
The User Group has roles attached to it that determines what users in this group are allowed to do.

In the backen folder you can find simple Cloudformation template that sets up a Cognito User Pool and Cognito Identity Pool.
